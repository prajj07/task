Built a dynamic 2-page React app that allows users to configure and execute custom button workflows. The Config Page enables setting the button label and sequencing actions like alerts, prompts, showing images/text, localStorage manipulation, and more. The Output Page displays a single button that executes the defined actions in order. Utilized localStorage for state persistence and ensured fully dynamic, modular behavior without hardcoding workflows. Designed a clean, component-based UI with runtime workflow updates.
